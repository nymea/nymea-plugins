# EVBox

This integration allows nymea to control EVBox wallboxes supporting the Protocol Max v4.

## Supported things

Generally, all EVBox wallboxes supporting the Protocol Max v4 are supported. We've tested it with

* Elvi 
* Elvi + MID meter

## Requirements

The EVBox Protocol Max v4 is based on a RS485 connection. This means, a RS485 port, either onboard or via USB adapter, is required on the nymea system.
The wallbox must be configured to not be cloud controlled, in order to accept commands on the RS485 port.
