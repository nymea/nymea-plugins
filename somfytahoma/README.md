# Somfy TaHoma

This plugin adds support for Somfy smarthome devices through the Somfy TaHoma
API.

are connected. The gateway needs to be registered to the Somfy API.
Follow the user guide of the gateway for detailed instructions.

entering your personal username + password for the Somfy TaHoma API.

## Supported devices

door drives that are connectable to the TaHoma gateway. These are Somfy iO
devices as well as RTS devices.
