# Shelly

The Shelly plugin adds support for Shelly devices (https://shelly.cloud).

Currently the Shelly1 and Shelly1PM are supported.

## Requirements
Shelly devices communicate with via MQTT. This means, in order to add Shelly devices to nymea, the nymea instance is required
to have the MQTT broker enabled in the nymea settings and the Shelly device needs to be connected to the same WiFi as nymea is
in. New Shelly devices will open a WiFi named with their name as SSID. For instance, a Shelly 1 would appear as "shelly1-XXXXXX".
Connect to this WiFi and open the webpage that will pop up. From there, it can be configured it to connect to the same
network where the nymea system is located. No other options need to be set as they can be configured using nymea later on.


## Setting up devices
Once the Shelly is connected to the WiFi, a device discovery in nymea can be performed and will list the Shelly device.
During setup, the connected device can be configured. If the Shelly is connected to e.g. a light bulb, choose "Light" here.
Optionally, a username and password can be set. If the Shelly device is already configured to require authentication,
the username and password here must match the ones set on the Shelly. NOTE: If the Shelly is not configured to require a
login yet, but credentials are entered during setup, the Shelly device will be configured to require authentication from
now on.

## Plugin properties
When adding a Shelly device it will add a new Gateway type device representing the Shelly device itself. It will allow
basic monitoring (such as the connected state) and interaction (e.g. reboot the Shelly device). In addition to that, a
power switch device will appear which will reflect presses on the Shelly's SW input. This power switch device also
offers the possiblity to configure the used switch (e.g. toggle, momentary, edge or detached from the Shelly's output).
If a connected device has been selected during setup, an additional device, e.g. the light will appear in the system and
can be used to control the power output of the Shelly, e.g. turning on or off the connected light.
