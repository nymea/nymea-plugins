# Heat pump

Information about the smart grid modes can be found [here](https://www.waermepumpe.de/sg-ready/).

In order to interact with the heat pump (SG-ready), this plugin creates a CoAP connection to the server running on the
6LoWPAN bridge. The server IPv6 can be configured in the plugin configuration. Once the connection is established, the
plugin searches for 6LoWPAN neighbors in the network.
