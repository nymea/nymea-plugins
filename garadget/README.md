The nymea plugin for Garadget Garage Door Opener requires Garadget version 1.20 or later 
nymea supports the Garadget device via the mqtt only mode using the nymea internal MQTT broker. External MQTT broker is not supported.
    Make sure nymeas MQTT broker is enabled in System Settings -> MQTT broker and create a policy (Client ID, username and password) for the garadget device to log in.
    
Note: The garadget must be configured with the MQTT mode only! otherwise the Particle operation will probably conflict.

See the (https://www.garadget.com/setup-instructions/) for garadget general setup and (https://community.garadget.com/t/mqtt-support/3226/5) for MQTT instructions

Garadget Initial Configuration:
    Put your device into listening mode: press and hold “M” button for about 3 seconds until LED starts blinking dark blue.
    Connect any WiFi enabled device to PHOTON-XXXX access point.
    Open http://192.168.0.1/ in the browser 
        Confirmed in settings that your Garadget is v1.20 or later.
    at a minimum set the following:
        select your SSID
        enter SSID password
        select Only MQTT
        enter nymead Broker IP: 
        enter nymead Broker Port:
        enter nymead Broker User ID: (if needed)
        enter nymead Broker Password: (if needed)
        enter Device Topic ID: (this must be unique across all garadget devices and contain NO /s allowed)
    select Save & Connect (The device will reconnect to your WiFi network via dhcp)

nymea configuration:
    assuming you have installed the garadget plugin:
    select garadget plugin from the ADD things page or Configure things page. 
    select Garadget (there will be an Internal MQTT client and MQTT client - Ignore them)
    Name the thing with your choice of names
    Thing Parameter -> enter the Device Topic ID: you entered in the Garadget device above.

nymea operation:
    on the Garadget window, the up icon, stop icon, and down icon cause the device to activate the garage door.
    on the Garadget detail window (uppre righthand corner, you can tune the Garadget configuration for:
        Refection Threshold
        Button Press Time
        Door Moving Time. (you should adjust to the time it takes your door to open)
    when changed it takes a couple seconds for Garadget to respond and update the values shown in the nymea window.

notes:
    Publish does not send any messages.
    other than the three types shown above and the open, close and stop items, no action is taken by the plugin.
    DECKO Garage Door opener requires a ~ 3.3 Volt zener diode in series of the connection between the Garadget and the DECKO

Issues: Garadget operating a DECKO garage door opener (may not be issue with other garage door openers)
    the Garadget can get confused on the correct relay actions to take if you hit "stop" and then either "open" or "close" when operating a DECKO 
    It is best to be in direct view of the door if you hit "stop" (the plugin image will be halfway up) to be sure you know where the door will go next.
    This confusion is an issue of the Garadget and not of nymea-plugin.

    The plugin will show connected as soon as the Garadget connects to the broker.
    The plugin does NOT know if the Garadget disconnects and therefore will continue to show connected even if the Garadget is no longer connected.
