This plugin provides support for the Bluetooth LE
[Xiaomi Flower Care Monitor](https://xiaomi-mi.com/sockets-and-sensors/xiaomi-huahuacaocao-flower-care-smart-monitor/).

The Xiaomi Flower Care sensor will provide information about temperature, soil moisture and conductivity as well as light intensity.
By default, the sensor value is refreshed from the sensor every 20 minutes. This setting can be changed to poll the sensor more or
less often, depending if more precise measurements or longer battery life are more important.
