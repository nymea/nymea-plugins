## Usage

### OWFS Interface
First step is to setup the "One wire interface". During the device setup it is required to enter the OWFS init arguments. Default arguments are "--i2c=ALL:ALL", means OWFS is about to scan for one-wire bus masters on all I2C interfaces.

You can simulate one-wire device with following init argument: "--fake=10,22,28,05"

More about init arguments here: https://www.owfs.org

The "One wire interface" thing has the toggle button to "Auto add one wire devices". Is this activated one-wire devices that get connected to the bus will appear in nymea automatically. 

NOTE: As long as the "Auto add one wire devices" feature is activated you won't be able to manually discover devices.

### W1 Kernel Driver
Install the kernel driver w1. Raspberry Pi users can use rasp-config to enable 'one wire' which enables W1. There are not further steps necessary, temperature sensors will be discovered if the driver has been loaded successfully.


## Requirements

* The package “nymea-plugin-onewire” must be installed.
